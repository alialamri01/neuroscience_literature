Title: The emperorâ€™s new wardrobe:Rebalancing diversity of animal models in neuroscience research

Authors: Michael M. Yartsev

-In the past a Neuroscientist would carefully define a scientific question, and then go seek out the model organism which is best suited 
to answer that question. Now, it seems as if the questions have been constrained to a handful of model organisms, atop which sits the 
mouse/rat, non-human primate, or humans themselves. 

***Krogh's Principle:	"for a large number of problems there will be some animal of choice, or a few such animals, on which it can be most conveniently studied"
