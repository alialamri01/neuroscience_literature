- This task is an urgent version of the memory based RDM stimulus (non-urgent), and is designed such that there is no lag (delay) between the perceptual evaluation of the stimulus and the motor action reporting it. 

- summarize line 11 - 15

Conclusion: Evidence accumulation signals in LIP may correspond to a slower, post-decision shift of spatial attention from the where the stimulus is (RDM stimulus) to where the saccade will end up (target).
