- Decision Making has evolved as an efficient transformation from the perceived state of the world (in addition to internal factors), to a space of possible motor actions (what about non-motor actions?)

    - Klaes et al. 2011
    - Kubanek and Snyder, 2015

- Gnadt and Andersen 1988 — developed the Memory Guided Saccade Task
- Platt and Glimcher 1998 — majority of neurons in LIPv exhibit the property of having a maximal visual response to the same stimulus which elicits the strongest response during the interval of a spatial working memory task (MGS) 

Question: CAN "ABSTRACT" REPRESENTATIONS OF DECISION RELEVANT INFORMATION, INDEPENDENT OF THE POSSIBLE MOTOR ACTIONS, COEXIST WITH REPRESENTATIONS OF DECISIONS AS INTENDED ACTIONS? 

  - if so, do these "abstract" representations even play a role in the decision-making process?

- Weakness of the design is that there are two configurations presented in different blocks; the internal state of the animal is not kept consistent. 

- Animals are encouraged to integrate motion information over 100s of milliseconds in order to extend the window in which decision formation can be integrated. 

- They show that the Firing Rates of neurons represent the state of the accumulated evidence only when the neurons belong to a pool representing the targets 

	- is this accumulated evidence for the decision? Or for the saccade? As in this configuration the decision is tied to a specific spatial location with no flexibility. 


Question: is it sound logic to fit a model to data, then using the model predict future events (such as choices in this case) and to then make a claim that the world operates in such a way which the model describes?
          How does one ensure that the model isn't extremely good at generalizing across many different contexts? and what would happen if we trained a different model which predicts the future events better? Could we say then that the second model provides a more accurate description of the world than the first? 


- Gnadt and Andersen 1988 ---  Barash et al. 1991a,b : LIP units can exhibit sensory-, memory-, and saccade-related responses. 

- Fanini and Assad, 2009  --- LIP is modulated by direction of motion, even in naive monkeys. 
                            - The latency of direction selectivity in naive monkeys is ~50ms after motion stimulus onset 

- Swaminathan and Freedman, 2012 --- The latency for direction category selectivity was found to be ~100ms. 

- In this study they find that the latency of direction selectivity in monkeys is 190ms after the onset of the dot stimulus 

- Hanes & Schall, 1996; Mazurek et al. 2003; Hanks et al. 2014 --- Decision making is terminated when a threshold level is detected by some other circuit (where is this circuit thought to be?) 

- In the Target-in-RF condition, if the correct target was in the RF and the animal saccades to that target then the neural responses, regardless of coherence level, coalese to a common firing right just before the saccade is modulated
  This is not observed when the animal is saccading to the target which is not in the RF, nor is observed in the RDM-in-RF configuration, where the activity is seperate for the different coherences up until the saccade (this is for either choice).
