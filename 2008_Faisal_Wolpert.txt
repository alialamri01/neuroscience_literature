Title: Noise in the Nervous System 

Authors: A. Aldo Faisal, Luc P.J. Selen, and Daniel M. Wolpert 

Abstract: 

- Noise is "random" disturbances of signals 

- Here they review sources of noise in the nervous system (molecular to behavioral), and how noise contributes to trial-to-trial variability


2 Sources of Noise: 

    1- deterministic properties of the system 
        * the initial state of the neural circuitry will vary at the start of each trial 
        *variability in the response will be exacerbated if the system's dynamics are more sensitive to the initial conditions 

    2- Noise 
        *Random or irregular fluctuations or disturbances which are not part of a signal or which interfere with or obscure a signal 
        *More generally, any distortions or additions which interfere with the transfer of information
